## How to use?
It's simple. Just build the project and press the space button on your keyboard.

## How it's work?

The project is based on the ["day and night" algorithm.](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/День_и_ночь_(клеточный_автомат)) The whole trick is that I apply it for each layer separately. In addition, I use the event probability, which allows you to achieve a chaotic distribution of biomes, as it happens in real life.

## Custom chaos!
You can add more chaos with the settings. To do this, you can use the settings file. For example, you can change the number of biomes, or their size.

## P.S.
This project was inspired by [the author of this channel](https://github.com/peaashmeter).
After I wanted to repeat his idea.
